// Validating benchmarks:
//    * Only 1 benchmark method in a group can have "Baseline = true" applied to it, group Job-DKAHFK(IterationCount=10) in class Test has 2

//    * Assembly BenchmarkConsoleApp which defines benchmarks references non-optimized WebApplication4
	If you own this dependency, please, build it in RELEASE.
	If you don't, you can disable this policy by using 'config.WithOptions(ConfigOptions.DisableOptimizationsValidator)'.

//    * Assembly BenchmarkConsoleApp which defines benchmarks is non-optimized
Benchmark was built without optimization enabled (most probably a DEBUG configuration). Please, build it in RELEASE.
If you want to debug the benchmarks, please see https://benchmarkdotnet.org/articles/guides/troubleshooting.html#debugging-benchmarks.
